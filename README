dcctrl.sh - a simple shell script making it a bit easier to interact with local (any)coind wallet

Initially developed for dogecoind, hence "dc" in its name.


USAGE:

Just take a look at source, it is pretty self-explaining.
Update DAEMON and DATADIR with actual pathnames in your system.

Examples:

Start / Stop the daemon:
$ dcctrl.sh start
$ dcctrl.sh stop

Shows your current address:
$ dcctrl.sh getaddress

Show the wallet status:
$ dcctrl.sh getinfo

...
I guess you already got an idea :)

If you have any suggestions on how to improve this script, don't hecitate to let me know.

If you find this script useful, support it:
