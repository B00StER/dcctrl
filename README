dcctrl.sh - a simple shell script making it a bit easier to interact with local (any)coind wallet daemon through your linux comsole.

Initially developed for dogecoin, hence "dc" in its name. But you can easily switch to any other criptocoins.


USAGE:

Just take a look at source, it is pretty self-explaining.
Update DAEMON and DATADIR with actual pathnames in your system.

Examples:

Start / Stop the daemon:
$ dcctrl.sh start
$ dcctrl.sh stop

Shows your current address:
$ dcctrl.sh getaddress

Show the wallet status:
$ dcctrl.sh getinfo

...
I guess you already got an idea :)
